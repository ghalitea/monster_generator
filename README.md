Generate a new monster:  
`python monster_gen.py`  
The newly generated monster stat block can be found under 'chaos_monster.pdf'

The code generates some stats, writes them into the 'chaos_monster.tex' file, and executes it with pdflatex. 'macros.tex' are some macros making it easier to generate a dnd monster stat block. They are neccesary for the execution of 'chaos_monster.tex',
